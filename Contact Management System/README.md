# Contact Management System
### Developed a program that allows users to store and manage contact information. The program will provide options to add a new contact by entering their name, phone number, and email address. It will also allow users to view their contact list, edit existing contacts, search contacts and delete contacts if needed. The program will store the contacts in memory for persistent storage.
