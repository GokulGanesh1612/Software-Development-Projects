# Sudoku Solver
### Created a webpage that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program takes an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and fills in the missing numbers. It uses backtracking to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers for the puzzle. Once solved, the program will display the completed Sudoku grid.
